                    <section class="mb-1">
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I was born in 1999(era of the internet, social networking, and the smartphone) so that makes me A GenZer, but all my life I have been called an old soul. I think this comes from my ability to put myself in other people's shoes, and take on a conversation from their perspective of life. From my understanding, Generation Z tends to value individual perspectives and we avoid labels. But to me, there is more to life than being stuck in your understanding of this world.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">People have so much to offer; stories about their experiences, trials and tribulations, and knowledge. Your eyes and ears are the passage to understanding life, take what you wish from a conversation, just know there is always more beneath the surface.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Up until I was around 10-12 I was generally a pretty shy kid, human interaction was anxiety-inducing for me as I would rather be in the comfort of my room. My bedroom was my little haven where I could retreat to, everything I owned had an assigned spot there as well as in my heart. It bothered me when I had company and they would jump around my room and knock things out of place, because 1. They should respect my space, 2. I didn’t want to clean up after them.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some hobbies I had as a kid were dissecting objects and putting them back together, I did this with the following items; remote controllers, fans, toys, and even an old GameBoy Advance. It satisfied me knowing that I could take something apart piece by piece to then put it together and everything would work just fine, but as we all do, I ran into many problems that I had to learn from.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Filled with curiosity to the brim.</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This leads me to my love of programming, computers fascinated me! Growing up in the age of the internet, social networking, and smartphones made me the man I am today. Instant messaging through AOL and designing my first MySpace page attributed to the love of the internet. Then came Minecraft, a wonderful survival game that was pretty much fully customizable as long as you knew how to HACK. At an early age, I assisted colleagues as an Administrator on multiple servers, to design, moderate, and deploy our creations for the world to enjoy.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">From Minecraft came my love for internet programming, I took these same concepts of designing, bug fixing, and deploying my projects for the world to see and then hit the ground running.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Originally I was going to a community college for Computer Science, but as we all know Computer Science is such a broad field! So I had to decide on an area of interest to delve deep into, and that happened to be Internet Programming. I would always Control-Shift-I pages and change things to impress my parents even before going to college for it, but the changes made went away as soon the page is refreshed, so I had to find a way to make the changes stay. </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I first started with HTML and CSS, dissected those languages until I could understand them thoroughly. Then I started learning PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery, and that’s when I knew there was no turning back. With those languages alone you can deploy a good-looking application, but as I furthered my knowledge in this field I found out about different styling frameworks(BootStrap), libraries(ReactJS), and databases.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My learning on the earth is certainly unfinished. This is my main driving force, I love to learn! If it wasn’t for all the objects I tore apart, not only in programming but in real life I’m not sure where I would be today. No one will understand the meaning of this life, but if you surround yourself with like-minded individuals that love to learn just as much as you do, you will most definitely get close to understanding your meaning in this life.</p>
